# i created this next app using this command
npx create-next-app@latest my-radix-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"

### now i want to create the professional portfolio so for that i want the complete comprehensive planning file which when i implement than i can easily develop the next app for pro level portfolio (which should be looks like the pro level developer's portfolio )

### This portfolio including these features and pages(the app is fully static not any api routes and there should be proper mock data files for project, skills and others and all the data should be comming from that in the object format)

1) there are 5 pages there 1) Home , 2) About, 3) skills , 4) Projects, 5) contact
2) in the home page there should be professional/modern(but nice looking )
    i) generic header which should be used in all other pages  
    ii) a professional/modern hero-section which should use the some nice/good looking animation from best library so that it should be best of best and modern(but not over look) hero-section in the world right now and professional/modern about section
    iii) and other projects-section, skills-section, get-in-touch-section, and testiminial section for client review (data come from the mock data files in the object format)
    iv) a professional/modern footer
3) About page with some important info and professional/modern about section 

4) skills page with all professional/modern skills cards and with detail page 
5) project page with all professional/modern projects cards and with detail page 
6) contact page with professional/modern contact us page (use the free library to send/recieve email from contact page (use Web3Forms if best ) with a button to download the cv(pdf file)
7) and all the sections of pages should be handled in this way that a professional and pro level content can be adjasted in the easy way 
7) there should be light and dark mode which should be globally managed using the local storage
8) there should be professional and modern and nice/awesom smooth animation(smooth scroll,hero-section animation but not over )
9) for all other pages except home , there should be professional and generic bred-crumb section with nice and professional animation 

10) there should be professional(not over look animation anymore but smooth and professional and pro level) animations + smooth transitions, buttery-smooth scrolling site-wide, including hero parallax,For advanced, pro-level effects  and you should use the best animation libraries like (Framer Motion,GSAP,Lenis)

so now give me the complete professional planning covering all the things and make sure when i implement this planning than code should be optimized , generic and professional and every things should be smooth and working well and smooth and looking completely professional and modern (not over look at all )
and also there should be professional color scheme with light and dark mode (use the redix ui or shade cd which should be compatible according to our requirements )
i want the complete professional planning files with phases in which first one is foundation phase which should be optimized and professional and generic and every things should be according to best practices of next js and optimized and working well and if some things are not in this prompt but important than also consider them in the planning and make sure after implementing this planning given you , the portfolio should be look the most professional and modern and nice looking like the pro level developer portfolio and looking the enter prize level touch and should be pro level touch and every things should be generic and professional and optimized and accoding to the best practices of the next js 

and make sure animation and color schemes(which should be easily switch to other color schemes with proper light and dark mode)  related planning should be strong which should be pro level and smooth and planning should be phase wise which should be professional and working well according to best practices of next js and over all others 

again i am very concious related to animation and color schems , so make sure it should be pro level
